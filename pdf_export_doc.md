To make the pdf_export tool work, you need to add Windows Print Froms of the Paper Sizes you want to print
to your Windows Print Management. Ever wanted to print a pdf to a certain format and added a "special" paper format in the print properties of your installed pdf printer. When you do this the paper format is also added to your Windows Print Forms.
